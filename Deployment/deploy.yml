    # We don't start the containers because we need to copy the env.yaml file into the backend container
    # before we can start anything.
    # So we first create the containers so that the next command "docker cp" can run properly
    # - name: Create containers for the pulled Docker images
    #   command: docker compose up --no-start

    # Now we actually run the Docker containers because the env.yaml has been copied and the app will no longer crash
    # Detached mode is required, otherwise Jenkins build never exits
    # even though the docker-compose up command has successfully executed
    - name: Run the pulled Docker images in detached mode
      command: docker compose up -d

    # This is added so that the Docker images of the previous builds
    # which will now become dangling images are removed
    - name: Prune the dangling Docker images
      command: docker image prune --force
